There are 3 classes in this file:

    - IoTServer: A class to accept request from outside.

    - IoTRequestHandler: A class to handle the socket
        generated after accepting a request by IoTServer.

    - Client: An agent for establishing a request to
        IoTServer.


and all of these would operate synchronously.
